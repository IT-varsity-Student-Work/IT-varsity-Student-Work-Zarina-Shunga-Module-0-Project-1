    <p> The Pearl of the Mediterranean has an ambiance more in keeping with its neighbours to the north than with those in the Middle East. Site of Pharos lighthouse, one of the Wonders of the World, and of Anthony and Cleopatraâ€™s tempestuous romance, the city was founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BCE. Today, Alexandria offers fascinating insights into its proud Greek past, as well as interesting mosques, the casino strip of the Corniche, some lovely gardens and both modern and traditional hotels.The history of Alexandria dates back to the city's founding, by Alexander the Great,  Yet, before that, there were some big port cities just east of Alexandria, at the western edge of what is now Abu Qir Bay. The Canopic (westernmost) branch of the Nile Delta still existed at that time, and was widely used for shipping. After its foundation, Alexandria became the seat of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and quickly grew to be one of the greatest cities of the Hellenistic world. The city fell to the Arabs  and a new capital of Egypt, Fustat, was founded on the Nile. After Alexandria's status as the country's capital ended, it fell into a long decline, which by the late Ottoman period, had seen it reduced to little more than a small fishing village.The city grew in the early 19th century under the industrialization program of Mohammad Ali, the viceroy of Egypt.The current city is the Republic of Egypt's leading port, a commercial, tourism and transportation center, and the heart of a major industrial area where refined petroleum, asphalt, cotton textiles, processed food, paper, plastics and styrofoam are produced</p>
